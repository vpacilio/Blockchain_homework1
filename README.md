In this smart contract project I wrote a smart contract to securely divide Ether evenly among the associate level employees and paym them accordingly.
I was able to write the contract to make payment of employees easily with one click once the employee wallet addresses were provided. 
In the screen shot in the file you can see the code and transfer of the ether.
